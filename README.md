# React & GraphQL â€“ From zero to production

Hey everybody! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my React & GraphQL workshop. In this workshop we are going to build a Twitter Lite application with React & GraphQL.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/glennreyes/react-graphql-workshop.git
cd react-graphql-workshop
yarn
```

## Working with the GraphQL Server

Move to the server folder:

```sh
cd server
```

Start server in dev/watch mode. This will re-run the server everytime you make changes in the source.

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Working with the React app

Move to the client folder:

```sh
cd client
```

Start the app with:

```sh
yarn start
```
